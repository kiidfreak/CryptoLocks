## üîß Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

Each feature is implemented as a separate React component with:
- **Props Interface**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- **State Management**: Local state for UI interactions
- **Event Handlers**: Callback functions for user actions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Data Flow

```
User Action ‚Üí Component Handler ‚Üí Mock Function ‚Üí Console Log ‚Üí Success/Error Toast
```

**Note**: Current implementation uses mock data and handlers. In production, these would integrate with:
- Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Smart contract calls for on-chain operations
- Real-time event listeners for blockchain updates

### UI Components Used

- **Shadcn UI**: Card, Button, Input, Label, Badge, Tabs
- **Custom Components**: Toast notifications, loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
